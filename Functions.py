# Functions in Python

# Like in maths, where a function takes an arguement and produces a result,
# it does so in Python as well

# The general form of a Python function is:
# def function_name(arguements):
#   {lines telling the function what to do}
#   return result

# Let's consider producing a function that returns x^2
# def squared(x):
#     result = x**2
#     return result
#
#
# print(squared(2))
# print(squared(5))
# print(squared(10))
#
# # Let's consider producing a function that returns x^2 + y^2
# def squared_addition(x, y):
#     result = x**2 + y**2
#     return result
#
#
# print(squared_addition(2, 2))
# print(squared_addition(5, 5))
# print(squared_addition(10, 5))

# def born(country):
#     return print("I am from " + country)
#
#
# born("England")
# born("France")
# born("Australia")
